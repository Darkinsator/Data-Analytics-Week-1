# Chapter 1: The Data Analyst

# What is Data analytics?
Data analytics is basically the science and techniques of analysing raw data to make conclusions about information.
Data analytics has many processes and techniques that have already been automated into mechanical processes  and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.
Data analytics can be used by a wide number  of entites such as businesses, to increase the overall performance therefore maximizing  their project

Analysts working with data move through a series of different steps as they seek to gain business value from their organization's data.
Analysts move through a process as they acquire new data, clean and manipulate that data, analyze it, create visualizations, and then report and communicate their results to business leaders.
These processes are:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Cleaning and Manipulation
3. Analysis
4. Visualization
5. Reporting and Communication

# Roles of a data anaylst
1. Data collection a preparation
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Visualization and Storytelling
4. Decision Support - Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions, providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.
5. Collaboration and Communication:
6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:

Analytical Techniques
Analysts use a variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal. To help you understand the purpose of different types of analysis, we often group these techniques into categories based on the purpose of the analysis and/or the nature of the tool. Let's take a look at the major categories of analytics techniques.

Descriptive Analytics
Predictive Analytics
Prescriptive Analytics

Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning
Algorithms are used in machine learning to extract knowledge from your datasets that you may utilize to inform future decisions. This is true irrespective of the particular field in which you operate, as machine learning finds application in a wide range of domains. 

Analytics Tools
Software helps analysts work through each one of the phases of the analytics process. These tools automate much of the heavy lifting of data analysis, improving the analyst's ability to acquire, clean, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data. They also provide invaluable assistance in reporting and communicating results.

# Chapter 2: Understanding Data

Data structure is an important factor in understanding how data works.

Data types is also important as it defines what catagory data goes into and also helps with data analysis.

Person Data

Let's explore some of the most common data types that give structured data its structure.

Character: The character data type limits data entries to allow only allow valid characters.Depending on your needs, multiple data types are available that can enforce character limits.

Alphanumeric: The most widely used data type for storing character data. Data element contains both numbers and letters. For example To accurately represent a given street address, both the house number and the street name are required.

Each database software has its unique method of implementing character data types to handle the nuances related to character data. The most significant difference has to do with how much data a particular data element can contain.

# Unstructured Data Types
While much of the data we use to record transactions is highly structured, most of the world's data is unstructured. Unstructured data is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model. 

# Categories of data

Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data
Quantitative data consists of numeric values.
Qualitative data consists of frequent text values.

Discrete vs. Continuous Data
Numeric data comes in two different forms: discrete and continuous.
Instead of counting, when you measure things like height and weight, you are collecting continuous data.
While whole numbers represent discrete data, continuous data typically need a decimal point.
Another way to think about it is that discrete data is useful when you have things you want to count
Instead of counting, when you measure things like height and weight, you are collecting continuous data. 

Categorical Data
In addition to quantitative, numeric data, there is categorical data. Text data with a known, finite number of categories is categorical.

Dimensional Data
Dimensional modeling is an approach to arranging data to facilitate analysis. Dimensional modeling organizes data into fact tables and dimension tables.
Fact tables store measurement data that is of interest to a business.
A table holding appointment data would be called a fact table.
Dimensions are tables that contain data about the fact. For appointment data, the veterinarian's office manager may want to understand who was at an appointment and if any procedures were performed.
